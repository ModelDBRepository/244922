plasticity and synaptic filtering by presynaptic mechanisms. J Physiol

</p><p>This NEURON code was contributed by CL Mukunda. The NEURON simulator is freely 
available from <a href="http://neuron.yale.edu">http://neuron.yale.edu</a>
</p><p>The model contains Na, KDr, KA, CaL, CaN and h-currents. AMPA receptor at the 
spine has been implemented with GHK equations. Most of the .mod files were 
obtained from previous studies except stp.mod, which implements 
Neurotransmitter dynamics at the terminal and cleft. 
</p><p>Output will be written to a "data" folder. Running the file 
"BPF.hoc" generates .txt files consisting data of EPSCs at spine, voltage at 
soma and terminal, Calcium concentration at the terminal, Neurotransmitter 
concentration at terminal and the synaptic cleft, for 1-50 Hz frequency 
stimulation. The EPSCs are inverted as per convention of inward currents being 
negative. High pass and Low pass filter profiles can be simulated by plugging 
in the values mentioned in the paper.
</p><p>EPSC_1.txt file is an example data generated by running BPF.hoc<p/>
  Note that the mod files must be compiled prior to running BPF.hoc.  If you need more help to run the model please see <br/>

  The included matlab file plot_ca_data plots this data in a format similar to Figure 2 C:
