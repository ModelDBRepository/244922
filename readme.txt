This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Mukunda CL, Narayanan R (2017) Degeneracy in the regulation of short-term 
plasticity and synaptic filtering by presynaptic mechanisms. J Physiol 
595:2611-2637

This code was contributed by CL Mukunda. The NEURON simulator is freely 
available from http://neuron.yale.edu

The model contains Na, KDr, KA, CaL, CaN and h-currents. AMPA receptor at the 
spine has been implemented with GHK equations. Most of the .mod files were 
obtained from previous studies except stp.mod, which implements 
Neurotransmitter dynamics at the terminal and cleft. 

Make a folder "data" in the same directory as the .hoc files. Running the file 
"BPF.hoc" generates .txt files consisting data of EPSCs at spine, voltage at 
soma and terminal, Calcium concentration at the terminal, Neurotransmitter 
concentration at terminal and the synaptic cleft, for 1-50 Hz frequency 
stimulation. The EPSCs are inverted as per convention of inward currents being 
negative. High pass and Low pass filter profiles can be simulated by plugging 
in the values mentioned in the paper.

EPSC_1.txt file is an example data generated by running BPF.hoc
